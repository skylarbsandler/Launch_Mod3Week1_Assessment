## Questions (10 Points)

1. Define HTTP and why it's important.
   HTTP is the set of rules for how the client and the server exchange information through the internet. Adhering to HTTP rules is essential so that the client and server can understand each other's requests and responses.

3. Using [Google Drawings](https://docs.google.com/drawings) Create a diagram of the request and response cycle when a user visits turing.edu. Include clear labels for all components. Put the link to your drawing below. (3 points possible) https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1ZZ5cOWR_iBfadhwvRGHcpea8jKlfyFAZh9UZ7x-3mHs/edit

4. Describe two parts of every HTTP request.
   Every HTTP request will have a path and a verb. The path is specific info about what info is being requested. The path can be found in the URL (ex. turin.edu/admissions). The verb is the action the server should take regarding the requested resource.

6. How do you describe the difference between HTML and CSS? use an analogy or an example in your answer.
   HTML is the structure, content, and semantics of a webpage. CSS is the styling and look of the webpage. CSS is similar to the wait staff at a restaurant. The patron (user) interacts with the wait staff to place and
   receive their orders. HTML is similar to the kitchen staff. The patron does not interact with them, but the kitchen staff receives the orders from the wait staff and prepares the meal based on the patron's specifications.

8. How can the chrome dev tools help with writing html and css?
   Dev tools in Chrome are useful because they provide concrete examples of how HTML and CSS come together to build a usable webpage. In Dev Tools, we can highlight and change different parts of the HTML and CSS code to
   see how our changes affect the webpage. We can also see the request method.

10. How do you open the chrome dev tools?
    There are multiple ways but I usually do: right click then inspect.

12. Why is it important to use semantic HTML tags?
    Semantic tags provide additional meaning through descriptive naming. This makes the code more understandable and readable for other developers and can additionally make web pages more accessible for users with
    things like verbal screen readers.

14. What are the three components of the box model?
    Margin, border, padding
